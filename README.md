# 🌸 In Loving Memory of Nila Cisneros

This repository contains a simple memorial website created to honor and remember my grandmother.

The site is intentionally minimal and timeless — a place to revisit her image, hear her voice, and preserve her words.  
It is hosted for free using **GitHub Pages** so it can remain accessible for years to come.

- Read a transcription of her words
